# Title of the project

## Objective of the Project
It describes what the project wants to achieve and defines terminologies. Presents the hardware or tools used in the project.

## The Systemâ€™s Architecture

### Overall Architecture
It describes what the project wants to achieve and defines the key terminologies of this project. Presents the hardware or tools used in the project.

### Description of the Modules
It describes all the modules within the architecture, i.e, (i) the inputs, (ii) the internal working, and (iii) the outputs.

## Implementation

### Prerequisites
It describes all hardwares and softwares that are required for running the system.

### How to run the project
It describes step by step how to download and run the project on a new computer.

## Results
It presents the result using (images or videos) of the working system, in (real or simulation).

## Recommendations
The Recommendations follow naturally from the conclusions. They describe: the assumptions made while building the system (and/or) the limitations of the working system. Therefore, presenting possible ideas that could overcome the limitations or assumptions. 

# Useful GitHub readme syntax

## To make bullet points

	* Do this

## To make hyper-link

For example, making a link to [ROS tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials)

## To show, how to execute some commands in the terminal

    ```
    sudo apt install ros-kinetic-opencv3 #(should be already installed with previous point)
    sudo apt install ros-kinetic-opencv-apps
    ```

## To exphasize about a particular command

For example: Please do a ```catkin_make ```, once you have modified your code.
